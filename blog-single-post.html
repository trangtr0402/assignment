				<h2>my thoughts about studying online</h2>
				<p>
					First semester,things were going smoothly for me. I really enjoyed my university life and the fact that I had a litte more time with my best friends at home was even nicer.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, after the long spring break, I began to miss the face-to-face interaction and thought about what have I missed while not being in Japan. The situation has been rough but I made a promise to myself that whatever may come, I have to keep up my spirit and overcome the challenges.
				</p>
				<p>
					During this time, I have more time to reflect on myself, do some soul-searching (but it did not lead to anywhere) and make some new friends in a brand way.
